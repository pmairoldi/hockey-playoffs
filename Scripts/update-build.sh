# This script automatically sets the version and short version string of
# an Xcode project from the Git repository containing the project.
#
# To use this script in Xcode, add the contents to a "Run Script" build
# phase for your application target.

# NOTE: make sure you add a new value to your Info plist called "FullVersion"
#
# NOTE: if you receive error saying 'fatal: Not a git responsitory', make sure |--git-dir| points
# to the root dir of your repo
#
# NOTE: if your git repo has no tags, this would fail, so make sure you create at least one tag
# (I usually create a tag '0.0.0' at the very first commit, you can do the same).

# But Apple wants this value to be a monotonically increasing integer, so

# play fast and loose with your Git history, this may cause you problems.
# Thanks to @amrox for pointing out the issue and fix.
